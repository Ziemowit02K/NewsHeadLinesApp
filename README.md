NewsHeadLinesApp:
App works on popular NewsAPI and will show you news from every country on the list from yout favourite category.
It's quite simple to make it run. All you have to do is find "apiKey" and past your key there. In the app you have only 10 results on every page, but you can change pages with "Next Button"
and "Previous" button. Hope you enjoy it
